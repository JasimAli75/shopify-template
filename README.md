## Getting Started

# Shopify Template

 This is full stack fully functional Shopify Template Project regarding by PIAIC Community

 Install latest Nextjs:

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

"npx create-next-app@latest"

What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*

After the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

Good to know:

Next.js now ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration by default.
You can optionally use a src directory in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.
